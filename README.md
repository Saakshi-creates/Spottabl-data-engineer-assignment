# Spottabl-data-engineer-assignment
This is a data engineering assignment that provides a dataset of companies as a list of JSON objects. Each object holds relevant data for a company, including information such as the company's name, domains it operates in, website URL, funding details, number of employees, and more.

The main tasks of this assignment are as follows:

1. Given a company name (similar to ones present in companyName), return the close competitors of the company, using any of the fields (or combination of fields) from the dataset. For example, competitors of Swiggy would be Zomato, FoodPanda, DoorDash, etc. since they all operate in similar domains and offer similar services.

2. Given a domain (any one of the domains in tags field), present the companies with the fastest and the slowest growth rate. This can be based on factors such as funding details, founded date, and more.

The goal of this assignment is to showcase data engineering skills such as data cleaning, data manipulation, and data analysis to extract valuable insights from the provided dataset.

### I've divided this assignment into 4 parts:
1. Cleaning a missing value imputation
2. Finding competitors algorithm
3. Getting slowest and the fastest growing companies as per the domain
4. Using tableau to get some insights based on the companies
